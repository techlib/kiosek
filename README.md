# NTK Kiosk Firefox Addon

Modified [Webconverger](http://webconverger.org/) extension.

The common idea is to limit the Firefox browser to functions for kiosk style
(non-personal) browsing. Limit most Firefox features to convey simplicity,
familiarity and principle of least astonishment.

Used at National Library of Technology, Prague, Czech Republic.

# Preferences
